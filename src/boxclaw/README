BoxCLAW
=======

This directory constains the BoxLib based version of PyClaw.

To obtain BoxLib, please visit:

  https://ccse.lbl.gov/pub/BoxLib/

After downloading and extracting the BoxLib tarball, please set the
BOXLIB_HOME environment variable accordingly:

$ cd BoxLib
$ export BOXLIB_HOME=$PWD

Once you have BoxLib, you can compile a standalone Python module that
contains BoxLib and PyBoxLib by running make:

$ cd $PYCLAW/src/boxclaw
$ make


Known issues
============

Currently only single processors runs work since communicating
interleaved multifabs is not implemented yet.


TODO
====

High priority
-------------

* state.py - create boxes and set ranges appropriately when running multiprocessors

Low priority
------------

* cfl.py - currently uses PETSc, change to use mpi4py or boxlib
* controller.py - change output format?
