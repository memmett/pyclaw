BoxCLAW
=======

This directory constains the BoxLib based version of PyClaw.

To obtain BoxLib, please visit:

  https://ccse.lbl.gov/pub/BoxLib/

After downloading and extracting the BoxLib tarball, please set the
BOXLIB_HOME environment variable accordingly:

$ cd BoxLib
$ export BOXLIB_HOME=$PWD

Once you have BoxLib, you can compile a standalone Python module that
contains BoxLib and PyBoxLib by running make:

$ cd $PYCLAW/src/boxclaw
$ make


TODO
====

* cfl.py - currently uses PETSc, could probably use plain mpi4py
* controller.py - currently calls fboxlib, just use mpi4py instead
* state.py - needs lots of work...
* grid.py - boundary conditions need work...
